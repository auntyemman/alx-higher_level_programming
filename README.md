# What is a High Level Programming Language?
 A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.

High-level languages are designed to be used by the human operator or the programmer. They are referred to as "closer to humans." In other words, their programming style and context is easier to learn and implement than low-level languages, and the entire code generally focuses on the specific program to be created.

A high-level language does not require addressing hardware constraints when developing a program. However, every single program written in a high-level language must be interpreted into machine language before being executed by the compute

# ADVANTAGES OF HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES
 The main advantage of high-level languages over low-level languages is that they are easier to read, write, and maintain. Ultimately, programs written in a high-level language must be translated into machine language by a compiler or interpreter.

The first high-level programming languages were designed in the 1950s. Now there are dozens of different languages, including Ada, Algol, BASIC, COBOL, C, C++, FORTRAN, LISP, Pascal, and Prolog.

# HIGH-LEVEL VS. LOW-LEVEL LANGUAGES
 Low-level languages require little interpretation by the computer. This makes machine code fast compared to other programming languages. Low-level languages gives programmers more control over data storage, memory, and computer hardware. It’s typically used to write kernel or driver software. It wouldn’t be used to write web applications or games.

In contrast, high-level languages are easier to grasp. It allows a programmer to write code more efficiently. High-level languages have more safeguards to keep coders from issues commands that could potentially damage a computer. These languages don’t give programmers as much control as low-level ones do.
