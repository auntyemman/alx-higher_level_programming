# Importing Modules
To make use of the functions in a module, youâ€™ll need to ```import``` the module with an ```import``` statement.

An ```import``` statement is made up of the import keyword along with the name of the module.

In a Python file, this will be declared at the top of the code, under any shebang lines or general comments.
