# If-else Statement
We could specify the statements that will be executed if a condition is true. Now, if you want to evaluate statements that determine whether a condition is actual and if a separate set of statements is false, you can use the if-else conditional statement.

The if-else statement is used to execute both the true part and the false part of a given condition. If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false, the else block code is executed.

# Syntax:
```if(condition):```

#Executes this block if the condition is true

```else:```

#Executes this block if the condition is false

You should note here that Python uses indentation in both the blocks to define the scope of the code. Other programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.
