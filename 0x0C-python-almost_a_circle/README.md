# What is *args and *kwargs
The *args and **kwargs keywords allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a Python function. The *args keyword sends a list of values to a function. **kwargs sends a dictionary with values associated with keywords to a function.

Both of these keywords introduce more flexibility into your code. This is because you donâ€™t have to specify a specific number of arguments upfront when writing a function
