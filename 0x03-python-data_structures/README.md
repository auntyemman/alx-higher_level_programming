# Data structure
The basic Python data structures in Python include list, set, tuples, and dictionary. Each of the data structures is unique in its own way. Data structures are “containers” that organize and group data according to type.

The data structures differ based on mutability and order. **Mutability** refers to the ability to change an object after its creation. Mutable objects can be modified, added, or deleted after they’ve been created, while immutable objects cannot be modified after their creation. **Order**, in this context, relates to whether the position of an element can be used to access the element.

# Python Data Structures – Lists
A list is defined as an ordered collection of items, and it is one of the essential data structures when using Python to create a project. The term “ordered collections” means that each item in a list comes with an order that uniquely identifies them. The order of elements is an inherent characteristic that remains constant throughout the life of the list.

Since everything in Python is considered an object, creating a list is essentially creating a Python object of a specific type. When creating a list, all the items in the list should be put in square brackets and separated by commas to let Python know that a list has been created. A sample list can be written as follows:

```List_A = [item 1, item 2, item 3….., item n]```

# Python Data Structures – Tuples
A tuple is a built-in data structure in Python that is an ordered collection of objects. Unlike lists, tuples come with limited functionality.

The primary differing characteristic between lists and tuples is mutability. Lists are mutable, whereas tuples are immutable. Tuples cannot be modified, added, or deleted once they’ve been created. Lists are defined by using parentheses to enclose the elements, which are separated by commas.

The use of parentheses in creating tuples is optional, but they are recommended to distinguish between the start and end of the tuple. A sample tuple is written as follows:

```tuple_A = (item 1, item 2, item 3,…, item n)```
